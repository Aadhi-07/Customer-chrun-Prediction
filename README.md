# SaaS Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting user churn using machine learning and serving it via a FastAPI backend.

# Project Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts whether a SaaS user is likely to churn.
A logistic regression classifier is trained on behavioral and demographic features, and the model is deployed as a simple API using FastAPI.

# Model Details

Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Performance: ~0.894 Accuracy on held-out data

Features: ~30 user behavior & demographic variables used for prediction
.

Data Source: saas_users.csv

# Quick Start
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Aadhi-07/Customer-chrun-Prediction.git
cd Customer-chrun-Prediction
```
2. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r require.txt
```

Make sure you are using Python 3.7+ and create a virtual environment if needed.

# Running the API

This project uses FastAPI to serve predictions:

Start the server
```
python -m uvicorn app:app --reload
```
# Test the API

To test the API locally:
```
python test_api.py
```

# How It Works

Data preprocessing – Encode categorical variables and scale/clean where necessary.

Model training – Train a logistic regression model to classify churn/no-churn.

Serialization – Save the model pipeline (churn_pipeline.pkl) and encoders (encoders.pkl).

API – Load pipeline in FastAPI and accept JSON requests to return predictions.

# Example API Request
```
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"feature1": value1, "feature2": value2, ... }'
```

You’ll get a prediction like:
```
{
  "churn_prediction": "Yes",
  "probability": 0.78
}
```
